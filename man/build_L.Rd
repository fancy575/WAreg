\title{Build Spline Basis Vector}
\usage{
build_L(t, sp_knots, degree, intercept)
}
\arguments{
\item{t}{A numeric value specifying the time at which to evaluate the basis.}

\item{sp_knots}{A numeric vector of knot locations.}

\item{degree}{A non-negative integer specifying the polynomial degree.}

\item{intercept}{Logical; if \code{TRUE}, assumes an intercept was included in the model.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector representing the spline basis evaluated at time \code{t}.
}
\description{
Constructs a spline basis vector evaluated at time \code{t} based on the provided spline knots,
polynomial degree, and intercept flag. When \code{intercept} is \code{TRUE}, the function returns
only the treatment-effect portion (i.e. powers 1:\code{degree} for each interval). When \code{intercept} is \code{FALSE},
it returns the full basis (i.e. powers 0:\code{degree} for each interval).
