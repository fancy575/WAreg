        Time-Varying Effects

Description: 
    WAreg implements a novel regression framework for modeling "while-alive" cumulative frequency 
    measures in clinical trials with composite endpoints. Composite endpoints combine two or more 
    distinct outcomes to enhance event incidence and improve statistical power. WAreg incorporate weighted composite endpoints and using spline-based methods to capture 
    time-varying effects. This flexible framework is applicable to both conventional randomized 
    trials and cluster-randomized trials. The package provides asymptotic variance, and visualization tools for practical implementation.
